# Book_Store_Inventory_Management

This is a project for a user to check all the books online, and also order a book online, in which case the inventory will get updated, and the book count will be reduced. 

Users can also use filters to search for a particular book based on book name, author name, price, etc. They can also search for books from a particular author. 

Admins can add books or delete books.
